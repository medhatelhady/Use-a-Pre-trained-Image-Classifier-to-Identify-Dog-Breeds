## Project: Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds



### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an python scripts like Atom, pycharm or VS code

### Objectives
1. identify which pet images are of dogs (even if breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.
 
2. classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.
 
3. Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2.
 
4. Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms take to run.
