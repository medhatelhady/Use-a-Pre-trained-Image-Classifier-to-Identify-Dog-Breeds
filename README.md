# Deep Learning
## Project: Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds



### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an python scripts like Atom, pycharm or VS code

### Objectives
1. identify which pet images are of dogs (even if breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.
 
2. classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.
 
3. Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2.
 
4. Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms take to run.

### Program Outline

1. Time your program
<br>
Use Time Module to compute program runtime
2. Get program Inputs from the user
Use command line arguments to get user inputs
3. Create Pet Images Labels
Use the pet images filenames to create labels
Store the pet image labels in a data structure (e.g. dictionary)
4. Create Classifier Labels and Compare Labels
Use the Classifier function to classify the images and create the classifier labels
Compare Classifier Labels to Pet Image Labels
Store Pet Labels, Classifier Labels, and their comparison in a complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
5. Classifying Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs"
Classify all Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" using dognames.txt file
Store new classifications in the complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
6. Calculate the Results
Use Labels and their classifications to determine how well the algorithm worked on classifying images
7. Print the Results

You will need to repeat these tasks for each of the three image classification algorithms that are provided to you.
